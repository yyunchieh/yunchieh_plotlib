# Visualization Package

# Overview
This package provides a set of visualization tools for data analysis and interpretation, including SHAP values, UMAP, t-SNE, time series plots, and histograms. The functions are designed to facilitate the exploration and understanding of complex datasets.

## Features

- **SHAP Visualization**: Create SHAP summary plots to understand feature importance in machine learning models.
- **UMAP**: Visualize high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space using UMAP for better interpretability.
- **t-SNE**: Generate t-SNE plots to reveal patterns in high-dimensional data.
- **Time Series Plot**: Visualize time series data with customizable parameters.
- **Histogram**: Create histograms to analyze the distribution of data.
